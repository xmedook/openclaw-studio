# OpenClaw Studio

Mission control for AI agents that actually do work.

OpenClaw Studio is the coordination layer that turns LLMs from "sometimes helpful" into compounding leverage. Orchestrate many scoped agents shipping PRs, running refactors, reviewing code, and doing research while you stay the intentional bottleneck. No chat wrappers. No autonomous black boxes. Just structured coordination of real side effects, with guardrails you'd bet your reputation on.

One strong human + many scoped agents + explicit coordination primitives. That's the thesis. Studio is how you prove it.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- OpenClaw Gateway running (local or remote)
- macOS or Linux; Windows via WSL2

## Quick start
### Install Studio (recommended)
```bash
npx -y openclaw-studio
cd openclaw-studio
npm run dev
```

What the installer does:
- Downloads OpenClaw Studio into `./openclaw-studio`
- Installs dependencies
- Prints a preflight checklist so it's obvious if you're missing npm/OpenClaw config or a reachable gateway
- Writes Studio connection settings under your OpenClaw state dir (for example `~/.openclaw/openclaw-studio/settings.json`) when possible, so the Gateway URL/token are pre-filled

### Start the gateway (required)

If you don't already have OpenClaw installed:
```bash
npm install -g openclaw@latest
openclaw onboard --install-daemon
```

Start a local gateway (foreground):
```bash
openclaw gateway run --bind loopback --port 18789 --verbose
```

Helpful checks:
```bash
openclaw gateway probe
openclaw config get gateway.auth.token
```

### Local vs remote

Local gateway (same machine):
- Gateway URL: `ws://127.0.0.1:18789`
- Token: `openclaw config get gateway.auth.token`

Remote gateway (EC2/Tailscale/etc.):
- Set the gateway URL + token in Studio Settings, or install with:
```bash
npx -y openclaw-studio --gateway-url wss://your-host:18789 --gateway-token <token>
```
- Sanity-check reachability:
```bash
openclaw gateway probe --url wss://your-host:18789 --token <token>
```
- If you prefer SSH tunneling:
```bash
ssh -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 user@your-host
```
Then connect Studio to `ws://127.0.0.1:18789`.

### Install (manual)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/grp06/openclaw-studio.git
cd openclaw-studio
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## Configuration

Paths and key settings:
- OpenClaw config: `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (or `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` / `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`)
- Studio settings: `~/.openclaw/openclaw-studio/settings.json`
- Default gateway URL: `ws://127.0.0.1:18789` (override via Studio Settings or `NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEWAY_URL`)

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing config**: Run `openclaw onboard` or set `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH`
- **Gateway unreachable**: Confirm the gateway is running and `NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEWAY_URL` matches
- **Auth errors**: Studio currently prompts for a token. Check `gateway.auth.mode` is `token` and `gateway.auth.token` is set in `openclaw.json` (or run `openclaw config get gateway.auth.token`).
- **Brain files fail to load**: Confirm Studio is connected, and your gateway supports `agents.files.get` / `agents.files.set`.
- **Still stuck**: Run `npx -y openclaw-studio@latest doctor --check` (and `--fix --force-settings` to safely rewrite Studio settings).
